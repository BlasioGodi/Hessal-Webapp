    <p class="paragraph-text">Here are some safety precautions you should take if you use LPG:</p>
    <ul class="list-lpg paragraph-text">
        <li>
            <strong>Use only approved appliances and equipment: </strong>Only use appliances and equipment that have
            been approved for use with LPG. These will have the appropriate safety features and will have been tested to
            ensure they are safe to use.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Have your LPG system inspected regularly: </strong>Have your LPG system and appliances inspected
            by a qualified professional on a regular basis. This will ensure that any leaks or other issues are detected
            and repaired before they become a safety hazard..
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Store LPG tanks and cylinders safely: </strong>Store LPG tanks and cylinders in a well-ventilated
            area, away from heat sources, and in an upright position. Make sure they are secured to prevent them from
            falling over.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Use proper ventilation: </strong>Make sure that the room or area where the LPG appliances are
            located is well ventilated. This will help to dissipate any gas that may leak, reducing the risk of fire or
            explosion.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Install a carbon monoxide detector:</strong> Install a carbon monoxide detector in the room or
            area where the LPG appliances are located. Carbon monoxide can be a by-product of incomplete combustion of
            LPG and can be fatal if inhaled in large concentrations.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Follow the manufacturer's instructions: </strong>Follow the manufacturer's instructions for using
            and maintaining your LPG appliances and equipment.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Have a fire extinguisher nearby: </strong>Keep a fire extinguisher nearby in case of emergency.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p class="paragraph-text">
        By following these safety precautions, you can reduce the risk of fire or explosion and ensure the safe and
        efficient use of LPG as a fuel source. It's also important to always be aware of the signs of gas leaks, like
        a strong smell of rotten eggs, hissing sounds, and dead or dying plants.
    </p>
    <h2>What to do if you suspect gas leaks at home?</h2>
    <p class="paragraph-text">
        If you suspect a gas leak in your home, it is important to take immediate action to prevent a potential fire
        or explosion. Here are some measures you should take if you suspect an LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) leak:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-lpg paragraph-text">
        <li>
            <strong>Evacuate the area immediately: </strong>Leave your home or the affected area and go to a safe
            place. Do not use any electrical switches or appliances, as they could ignite the gas.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Shut off the gas supply: </strong>If possible, locate the main gas valve and turn it off. This
            will stop the flow of gas and reduce the risk of fire or explosion.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Open windows and doors: </strong>Open windows and doors to allow fresh air to circulate and help
            dissipate any gas that may have leaked.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Do not use any electronic devices: </strong>Do not use any electronic devices such as phones,
            lights, or appliances, as they could ignite the gas.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Call for professional help: </strong>Call the gas company or a licensed plumber to come and check
            for leaks and repair any damage.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Do not return until it's safe: </strong>Do not return to the affected area until it has been
            declared safe by a professional.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="paragraph-text">
        It's also important to have a carbon monoxide detector, and to have them checked regularly to ensure they are
        working properly. It's also important to have regular maintenance check-ups and to be aware of the signs of
        gas leaks, like a strong smell of rotten eggs, hissing sounds, and dead or dying plants.
