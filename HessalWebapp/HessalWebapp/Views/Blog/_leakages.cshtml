    <p>
        There are different types of LPG leak detectors available on the market, each one uses a different technology
        to sense the presence of LPG.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-lpg">
        <li>
            <strong>Electrochemical: </strong>These detectors use a sensor that detects the presence of LPG gas by
            measuring the concentration of the gas in the air. The sensor is typically a small cell that contains a
            chemical which reacts with LPG gas, producing an electric current that is proportional to the concentration
            of gas in the air. If the concentration of gas exceeds a preset limit, the detector will trigger an alarm.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Catalytic bead: </strong>These detectors use a small bead coated with a substance that reacts with
            LPG gas to produce heat. When the heat generated exceeds a certain level, the detector triggers an alarm.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Infrared: </strong>These detectors use infrared technology to detect the presence of LPG gas. They
            work by measuring the absorption of infrared light by LPG gas. A sensor in the detector detects the specific
            infrared signature of the LPG gas and triggers an alarm if the level exceeds a certain threshold.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Ultrasonic: </strong>These detectors use sound waves to detect the presence of LPG gas. They work
            by measuring the reflection of sound waves off the LPG gas. An electronic sensor in the detector picks up
            the sound waves and triggers an alarm if the level exceeds a certain threshold.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        LPG leak detectors are typically installed in the area where appliances are located, such as the kitchen,
        garage or basement. When a leak is detected, most detectors will trigger an audible alarm which alerts the
        user. They are an important safety feature that can help prevent fires and explosions by alerting you to the
        presence of LPG gas, giving you time to take action and prevent a potential incident.

    <div>
        <ul class="list-lpg">
            <li>
                When LPG leaks, it has a tendency to sink. The properties of LPG make it denser than air, causing it to
                sink.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Leak detector, which is usually located at low levels, will sense the presence of LPG as it sinks.
                The alarm within the detector will be activated as soon as a percentage threshold of LPG volume in
                relation to the air within the room, is reached.
            </li>
            <li>
                Activation of the alarm will result in immediate triggering of the solenoid valve, cutting of any
                further gas leaks from the LPG cylinders.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the event of a fire breakout, an emergency panic button that is installed at the nearest fire exit
                point, can be used to automatically cut-off gas supply using the same solenoid valve
            </li>

    <h3 class="mt-20">Components of the detection system</h3>
    <p>
        A gas leak detection system is designed to detect and alert when a gas leak occurs. The main components of a
        gas leak detection system typically include:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-lpg">
        <li>
            <strong>Sensors: </strong>These are the devices that detect the presence of gas. They can be infrared,
            catalytic bead, or electrochemical sensors.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Control panel: </strong>This is the hub of the system, it receives the signal from the sensors,
            process the signals and triggers an alarm if gas is detected.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Alarm: </strong>An audible and/or visual alarm is activated when a gas leak is detected, it can be
            a siren, strobe light, or both.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Power supply: </strong>The system needs a power supply to function, it can be AC or DC power.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Communication devices: </strong>Some systems include communication devices such as GSM/GPRS modems
            or IP communication modules that allow the system to send alerts to remote locations or to a monitoring
            centre.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Actuators: </strong>Some systems use actuators to automatically shut off the gas supply in case of
            leak detection.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Calibration unit: </strong>This component is used to calibrate the sensors and ensure they are
            functioning properly.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Maintenance and diagnostic tools: </strong>Some systems include tools to help with maintenance and
            troubleshooting.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Remote monitoring and control: </strong>Some systems allow remote monitoring and control of the
            system through the use of software or mobile app.

        It's important to note that there are different types of gas detection systems and not all of them will have
        all the components mentioned above, the specific components may vary depending on the type of gas, the
        environment, and the application.
    </p>
    <h2>How do you ensure that your Gas Leak Detection System is working properly?</h2>
    <p>There are several ways to ensure that a gas leak detection system is working properly:</p>
    <ul class="list-lpg">
        <li>
            <strong>Regular inspections and maintenance: </strong>It is important to schedule regular inspections and
            maintenance for the gas detection system. This includes checking the sensors for proper function, replacing
            any damaged or worn parts, and ensuring that the alarms are working properly.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sensor calibration: </strong>Sensors need to be calibrated on a regular basis to ensure they are
            detecting gas accurately. Calibration can be done with a gas mixture or a gas generator that simulates a gas
            leak.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Test alarms: </strong>Test the alarms regularly to ensure they are working properly. This can be
            done by activating the alarm manually or by simulating a gas leak with a gas mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Record keeping: </strong>Keep records of all inspections, maintenance, and calibrations. This can
            help to identify any problems and ensure that the system is operating at peak performance.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Remote monitoring: </strong>Some systems allow remote monitoring of the system through the use of
            software or mobile app. This can help to detect any problems early on and allows for quick response and
            repair.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>False alarms: </strong>False alarms can be caused by a variety of factors, such as dust, humidity,
            or other environmental factors. These factors can be reduced by proper maintenance and cleaning of the
            sensors and the surrounding areas.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It's important to note that gas detection systems should be installed, maintained and serviced by a qualified
        and experienced technician or company following the manufacturer's instruction and local regulations.
