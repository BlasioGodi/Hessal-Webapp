    "Highlight": "What is Liquefied Petroleum Gas?",
    "Summary": "LPG stands for Liquefied Petroleum Gas. It is a mixture of hydrocarbons, primarily propane and butane, that are in the gaseous state at ambient temperatures and pressures, but can be converted to liquid form under moderate pressure for storage and transportation. It is a versatile fuel source with a wide range of applications. Itâ€™s clean-burning nature and portability make it a suitable choice for many different settings and industries.",

    "Summary": "Installing earthing to a gas tank involves connecting a conductor, typically a copper wire, from the tank to a grounding rod buried in the ground. This creates an electrical connection between the tank and the earth, which helps to dissipate any static electricity that may build up on the surface of the tank. This is important because static electricity can potentially ignite the gas inside the tank, causing a fire or explosion.",
